Hi Team,

My Native is Rasipuram,Namakkal. I completed B.E. Civil Engineering from Kumarasamy college of engineering and Technology in Karur. I got passed out in 2019 with 8.79 CGPA with distinction in academics.

After that I was rigorously preparing for government exams for last 3 years and gave few exams but could not clear it. Meanwhile due to covid pandemic situation, exams were postponed. Because of that my efficiency towards government exams got decreased.

Recently I got married and moved to Chennai. My husband is a java developer having 7 years of experience in software field. But I have an ambition to get a job, I took decision to enter into software field. Now I am studying software training course in Qspiders, Chrompet and like to work in software testing and development. I have a long term passion to work in an organisation.

Thanks,
Yogashree Gunasekaran
